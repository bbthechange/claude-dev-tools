## Architecture

This project follows the patterns defined in `context/{{ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE}}`. Read this document before making changes.

## Context Directory

The `context/` directory contains documentation that helps Claude understand specific parts of the codebase:

{{#if iOS}}
- **{{ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE}}** - Core architecture patterns (MVVM, state management, logging)
- **Page-specific docs** - Each major screen/feature should have its own context doc describing:
  - What the page does
  - Key ViewModels and their responsibilities
  - Navigation flows
  - API endpoints used
  - Any special patterns or gotchas
{{/if}}

{{#if Android}}
- **{{ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE}}** - Core architecture patterns (MVI, state management, logging)
- **Page-specific docs** - Each major screen/feature should have its own context doc describing:
  - What the page does
  - Key ViewModels and their state/intent/effect contracts
  - Navigation flows
  - API endpoints used
  - Any special patterns or gotchas
{{/if}}

{{#if Backend}}
- **API group docs** - Each group of related endpoints should have a context doc describing:
  - What the endpoints do
  - Request/response formats
  - Authentication requirements
  - Error handling patterns
  - Database interactions
{{/if}}

When adding new features, create or update the relevant context doc so Claude can understand and work with that code effectively.
